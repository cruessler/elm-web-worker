      This app demonstrates how to send messages to and from a
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">Web Worker</a>
      when using Elm. All this application does is send 10 messages to the
      worker which responds to each message by sending a message itself. Each
      time the main application receives a message, it increments its counter
      which you see below.
